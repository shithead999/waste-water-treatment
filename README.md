Data Set Information:

This dataset comes from the daily measures of sensors in a urban waste
water treatment plant. The objective is to classify the operational
state of the plant in order to predict faults through the state
variables of the plant at each of the stages of the treatment process.
This domain has been stated as an ill-structured domain.

Attribute Information:

All atrributes are numeric and continuous
